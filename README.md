This project is a SaaS Boilerplate using Supabase for authentication, database, and backend services. It is inspired by modern SaaS architectures and is ready for rapid development.

## Folder Structure

- `components/` - Reusable React components
- `libs/` - Utility libraries (Supabase client, API helpers, etc.)
- `models/` - Data models (if needed for client-side validation/types)
- `public/` - Static assets

## Getting Started

2. Set up your Supabase project and add your keys to `.env.local`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
